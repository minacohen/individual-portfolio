    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here is an example of a project I am working on with the basketball team...</p>
    <p>This chart represents the player load for 12 of the players during a practice. Player load is a calculation used to measure the work a player is exerting during practice. Tracking player loads tells trainers and coaches how hard each player is working during a practice, a game, or an individual drill. One assignment I am working on using this player load chart is to break down player load by drill and create a bank of drills ranked by thier dificulty. You have to take into consideration that certain players have to take more steps or move quicker because of their size. Jon Teske has a lower player load because he is so tall and it takes him less steps to get from point A to point B compared to smaller memebers of the team. I love working with the team and getting to see them practice and play basketball, all while engaging in the world of data which I also love.</p>
