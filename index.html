      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi! I am a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information studying Information Analytics. I was born and raised in New York City. I am the youngest of three kids, in a family where all 5 of us went to the University of Michigan! I work with the University of Michigan Men's Basketball Team as their data analyst. I attend practices and games tracking the data of the team and then working with coaches and athletic trainers to find ways to improve player performance. When I graduate I hope to continue working as a data analyst in the sports world. </p>
